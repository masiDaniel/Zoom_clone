# Zoom Clone (Learning Project)

A **learning-focused clone inspired by Zoom**, built to explore **real-time communication**, **video conferencing**, and **distributed systems**.

> This project is **not affiliated with or endorsed by Zoom Video Communications**.  
> This project is for **educational and portfolio purposes only**.

---

##  Project Purpose

This project was created to understand the **core engineering challenges behind real-time video communication systems**, including signaling, peer connections, and session management.

The emphasis is on **how video conferencing works under the hood**, not on replicating Zoom’s UI or enterprise features.
